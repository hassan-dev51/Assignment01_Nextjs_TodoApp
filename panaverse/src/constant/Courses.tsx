Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this course, you will learn how to develop cloud applications using cloud-native technologies like Containers, Kubernetes, and CDK for Kubernetes",

      "By creating a token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralized service in the future.Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use OpenZeppelin contracts. You will use the Hardhat development environment. Also, write at least twenty automated tests. We will be using Solidity and Typescript for development",

    projectPart4Title: "Develop Crowd Sale Contract",
    project4Description:
      "This contract will be responsible for allowing users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token) Implement a payable buyToken() function.  Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought Transfer 75% of the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal 'owner' account.Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.",

    project5Description:
      "While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet! We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed. When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts were uploaded to and copy it.Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.After the transaction has been confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to 'register' it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!To do this, open the side menu and click on the 'Add token' button to get started:Once you're on the token page, click on 'Add custom token' and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!",
